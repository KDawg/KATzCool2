# KATCool2 Color Theme

This is my hand-tuned dark color theme for use in the amazing dev tools RubyMine and PHPStorm
by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/).

It's something I've honed over the year little by little to suit my taste. No doubt in
my mind that it's influenced by dozens of fantastic dark-colored themes, but I don't
have any particular references to call out.

Give it a try and see how to you like it. If it's useful for you please pass on a kind
word about it to your friends and teammates.

Here's how this color theme makes JavaScript look:

# PHPStorm Support

Languages the color theme supports are just about all of them and especially Ken-centric including:
* JavaScript
* SCSS/SASS
* Jade
* Regex
* HTML
* CSS
* SQL
* PHP

## File Extensions (Apr.19.2013)
I just noticed upgrading to PHPStorm v6 JetBrains ditched .xml config files for .icls files.
Of course that means I'll be maintaining .icls on PHPStorm now, and RubyMine once they make
the shift there.

## Install Location for OSX
Typical PHPStorm v6 location for this file is something like this:

# Favorite Fonts
This programmer font is highly recommended as I've used it daily for years and I know
I'm more productive because it exists:

[Bitstream Vera Sans Mono](http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font)

Out of nowhere I've suddenly switched to this font as Adobe dropped it on the world just
a few weeks ago and I think it's fantastic:

[Adobe Source Code Pro Mono](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html)
